- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Max Planck Institue for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig and am part of the [Economics Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/jjost/research/economics.html). 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about estimation, validation and calibration of agent-based models using the method of simulated moments.
- ðŸ‘¯ I discover the relevance of (broken) ergodicity in another context almost every day. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with passionate people on further developing ergodicity economics (EE) and applying it to open research problems and specific real-word problems in economics or elsewhere.
