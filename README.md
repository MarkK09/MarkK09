### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile

<!--
**MarkK09/MarkK09** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Max Planck Institue for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/){target="_blank"} in Leipzig and am part of the [Economics Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/jjost/research/economics.html){target="_blank"}. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the estimation of agent-based models using the method of simulated moments.
- ðŸ‘¯ I discover the relevance of (broken) ergodicity in new contexts almost every day. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with passionate people on further developing ergodicity economics (EE) and applying it to open research problems or specific real-word problems in economics or elsewhere.
