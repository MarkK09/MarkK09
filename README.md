- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institue for Mathematics in the Sciences</a> in Leipzig and am part of the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/jjost/research/economics.html" target="_blank">Economics Group</a>. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about estimation of agent-based models using the method of simulated moments.
- ðŸ‘¯ I discover the relevance of (broken) ergodicity in another context almost every day. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with passionate people on further developing ergodicity economics (EE) and applying it to open research problems and specific real-word problems in economics or elsewhere.
